<!-- [(ngModel)]:
Binds the username property in the component to the input field.
Updates the username property whenever the user types in the input field.
Key Notes:
Two-way binding with [()] is commonly used with Angular's ngModel directive (from FormsModule).
It simplifies the process of keeping the UI and the component's state in sync.
This syntax is particularly useful in forms and interactive components where real-time updates are needed. -->
